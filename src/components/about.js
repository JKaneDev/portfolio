					In 2022 I decided to become a Blockchain Developer. After going through the curriculum of Harvard's CS50, The
					Odin Project's Node.js Path & DApp Universities Blockchain Developer Bootcamp - I developed a solid set of
					skills in various technologies and a strong grasp of programming fundamentals that gave me the confidence to
					develop my own Web3 projects. I demonstrate these skills in my capstone project - a Twitter Clone built on
					Ethereum. Click the link below to see this project and a few hours I had a blast making.
